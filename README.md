# rip-routing
This project is an example implementation of a simple RIP (Routing Information Protocol) visualization.
It uses the MVC pattern with elements for the Observer Pattern to handle updates.
The idea was to use just plain html and cdn scripts, the simplest it can be. It's kept minimal to focus on the patterns and RIP's core mechanics.

## Setup
Run your favorite http server.

```console
foo@bar:~$ py -m http.server 8080
